            <h1>Magu 麻姑</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">She is the Taoist Goddess and symbolic protector of women in Chinese mythology. Her name directly translates to “Hemp Maiden”. In Ancient China, the cannabis plant was highly valued in the Taoist religion for its healing and spiritual properties. Magu is often depicted carrying a basket of hemp and peaches, which were said to have healing abilities.</p>

                  <h4>Balance</h4>
                  <p class="text-center">This app was created to help women find balance. With ever fluctuating hormone levels, it's difficult for many women to stay centered. This rising tide of hormones can jerk the female brain around so much that it's hard to find an alternative solution to presecription medication. Magu wants women to use cannabis as a natural remedy, and to use it conciously.</p>
